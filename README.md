# Data Structures and Algorithms

Learning and refreshing DSA with the [Data Structures and Algorithms Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-structures-algorithms) on Coursera by UC San Diego. 

Six courses in total, each 3-6 weeks long (about 12-18 hrs a week). 

**This repo has attempts at the programming assignments and challenges. Be sure to stick to the honor code. This repo is primarily for my own use and for discussion with friends.**
